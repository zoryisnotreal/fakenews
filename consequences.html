population from the abuse of power by the powerful. In such a system, are we being told the
truth about the function of our economies?”</span>

                    The average person is lied to about their country’s current political and economic state. The media blinds the public and their opinions. As stated, one of the most direct consequences is a disproportion power over the political system:

                    <li>The wealthy have better access to reliable sources and therefore better access to the political system.

                    <li>
                        The wealthy also has control over private media, dictating what the public knows and does not know.

                <span> Consequently, the public has no direct access to the truth. </span>

                <br> Fake media removes the ability to question. Rather than critique and view the Internet in a more questionable way, the public takes all information as truthful, spreading them without any evaluation.
