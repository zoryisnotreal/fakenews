            The Definition of Fake News:
        </h3>


        <h4>
            Fake news can be plainly defined as a false spread of information through media.
        </h4>


        <p>
            But to fully understand how fake news is conducted and spreads, the definition must be taken apart.
            <br>
            <br> According to Axel Geffert, he chooses to break apart fake news into subsections: <em>‘news’ </em> and
            <em>‘fake’ </em>.
            <br>
            <br> Furthermore, he continues to discuss how news becomes falsified when glanced through the perspective of a consumer, not a writer:
        </p>


        <div id="quote">
            “To the extent to which news media have received attention in epistemology, the emphasis has been on their reliability as a source of factual information for the consumer. On this account, <strong>consumers of news media are the recipients of a specialized form
            of testimony, </strong> and anyone who relies on, say, the New York Times or the BBC World News as authoritative sources of factual reports about the world incurs broadly the same epistemic rights and responsibilities as any recipient of ordinary
            testimony does.”
        </div>

        <aside id="explain">
            News has become tied with media. Therefore, the factuality of the news has only been tied with information appealing to the consumer. Consumers rely on interesting stories to remain engaged and therefore rely on news outlets to keep their attention span
            through such stories. however, this results in major news outlets relying less on factual testimony and more on specialized testimony.
