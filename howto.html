                Reliability is tricky to find in this day and age. Even the most academic sites can have a biased view.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to UTEP CONNECT, the 4 following steps are ways to discern if a site is reliable:
            </p>

            <div class="stepone">
                <p class="step"> Step One: Check the domain name </p>

                <img class="desktop" src="assets/media/orgvs.png" alt=".org vs .com" width="500" height="350">
                <img class="mobile" src="assets/media/orgvsnew.png" alt=".org vs .com" width="1000" height="700">

                <p class="define"> Sites that end with “.com” are commercial sites and tend to be less reliable. However, sites that end with “.edu”, “.org”, or “.gov”, are institutional sites and have a more reliable background.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="steptwo">

                <p class="step"> Step Two: Take a closer look at the source </p>
                <img class="desktop" src="assets/media/citation.png " alt="citation " width="500 " height="350 ">
                <img class="mobile" src="assets/media/citationnew.png " alt="citation " width="1000 " height="700 ">
                <p class="define">
                    Check if the source has a bibliography or cites other authors. Check the credentials of the author or authors to see if they are a professional in the topic. If nothing comes up for either or both of these questions, then the site probably has an unreliable
                    narrator. </p>


            </div>

            <div class="stepthree">
                <p class="step"> Step Three: Search for additional background for what you’ve found </p>
                <img class="desktop " src="assets/media/firmbee.jpg " alt="Research " width="500 " height="350 ">
                <img class="mobile " src="assets/media/firmbeenew.png " alt="Research " width="1000 " height="700 ">
                <p class="define"> Take everything you see online with a grain of salt. Don’t be afraid to search different perspectives and to double check if any information you’ve seen is accurate. If you search for additional sources and there are no other places featuring
                    the topic or only places that seem unreliable, then the said source may be unreliable as well</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stepfour">
                <p class="step"> Step Four: Use Certain sites to only jump-start additional research </p>


                <img class="desktop" src="assets/media/wikipedia.jpg " alt="Wikipedia Search Results " width="500 " height="350 ">
                <img class="mobile" src="assets/media/wikipedianew.png " alt="Wikipedia Search Results " width="1000 " height="700 ">
                <p class="define"> While the internet is full of many great sites with vast information, many can be corrupted. Sites like Wikipedia should NOT be the source for research but rather a way to look for more, since this site can be altered by any user. </p>
